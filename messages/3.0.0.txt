SystemVerilog 3.0.0 Changelog:

This updates addresses the new API available with ST builds 4050+, mainly the new auto-completion.

## Improvement ##
 - Auto-Completion:
  * Makes full use of the new Auto-completion API by providing kind and more details info
  * Enum Auto-completion is now available in more cases
  * All snippets have been move to settings part (sv.completion.core) to allow easy customization by user.
    Those snippets have additional filter to prevent them to appear in unwanted places (e.g. class snippet only appears when there is no top scope)
 - Highlight :
  * Add scope to punctuation separator/terminator
